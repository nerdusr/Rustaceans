    move in rust
    "move" refers to a concept related to ownership and memory management.
    Rust has a unique ownership system, and when a value is "moved," the ownership of that value is transferred
    from one variable to another. After the move, the original variable is no longer valid and cannot be used,
    preventing issues like double free errors or dangling pointers.

    For example:

    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("Hello");
        let s2 = s1; // Ownership of the String is moved to s2

        // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile-time error
        println!("{}", s2); // This works fine
    }

    Here, s1 owns the string initially, but when we assign s1 to s2, the ownership is moved to s2, and s1 becomes invalid.
    This move semantics is a key feature of Rust's design, ensuring memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

    // Rust will call the 'drop' function immediately.
